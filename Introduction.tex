\section{General introduction to the domain of the thesis}

What is \gls{ble}? Why was it developed and who/where is it being used?  \cite{Gomez2012}

What is Contiki \gls{os}? Why was it and who/where is it being used? Explain the amount of R\&D done in terms of communication protocols based on 802.15.4 \cite{Contiki}.


\section{Problem definition}
Need for \gls{ble} in Contiki as a platform for \gls{iot}. To understand the characteristics of \gls{ble} and 802.15.4 so that we can identify the applications suitable for these protocols.

\section{Goal}
To choose and integrate a \gls{ble} hardware platform with Contiki. To compare \gls{ble} and 802 in various performance criteria of data-rate, latency, reliability and energy consumption in environments with and without external interference.
