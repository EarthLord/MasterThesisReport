\section{Research Method}
In this experimental research project large amount of data was generated to compare the two protocols mentioned, hence it utilizes quantitative research method. The approach followed was deductive as the experiment started off by defining the metrics to evaluate, followed by designing the tests to conduct and finally deducting the conclusions based on the analysis of data collected from the tests conducted.

The data collected was condensed with descriptive statistics and graphical representation was used to showcase this information \cite{trochim2005research}. Univariate analysis of the data collected for all the metrics of the two protocols was done from these graphical representation. For the data for some of the metrics bivariate analysis was also done to compare the two protocols from these graphical representation.
