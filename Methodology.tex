\section{Research Method}

In this experimental research large amount of data was generated to compare the two protocols mentioned, hence utilizing quantitative research method. The approach followed was deductive as the experiment started by defining the metric to measure, then designing the test to perform and finally deducting the conclusions based on the collected data from the tests.

The data collected was condensed with descriptive statistics and graphical representation was used to showcase this information\cite{trochim2005research}. Univariate analysis of all the metrics of the two protocols and bivariate analysis of some metrics was done to compare the two protocols from these graphical representation.
