abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a recently developed energy-efficient short-range wireless communication protocol. In this paper, we discuss and compare the maximum peer-to-peer throughput, the minimum frame turnaround time, and the energy consumption for three protocols, namely BLE, IEEE 802.15.4 and SimpliciTI. The specifics and the main contributions are the results both of the theoretical analysis and of the empirical measurements, which were executed using the commercially available hardware transceivers and software stacks. The presented results reveal the protocols’ capabilities and enable one to estimate the feasibility of using these technologies for particular applications. Based on the presented results, we draw conclusions},

abstract = {Electronic wireless sensors could cut medical costs by enabling physicians to remotely monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood oxygenation while patients remain at home. According to the IDC report "Worldwide Bluetooth Semiconductor 2008-2012 Forecast," published November 2008, a forthcoming radio frequency communication ("wireless connectivity") standard, Bluetooth low energy, will link wireless sensors via radio signals to the 70\% of cell phones and computers likely to be fitted with the next generation of Bluetooth wireless technology, leveraging a ready-built infrastructure for data transmission. Analysis of trends indicated by this data can help physicians better manage diseases such as diabetes. The technology also addresses the concerns of cost, compatibility, and interoperability that have previously stalled widespread adoption of wireless technology in medical applications.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the development of wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and IPv6-based solution for sensor networks has attracted more and more attention which can enable end-to-end IP communication via the Internet. As far as we know, we implemented the first prototype system to transmit IPv6 packets over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based on BlueZ, the official Bluetooth stack of Linux. To adapt IPv6 packets to BLE link, in addition to the implementation of segmentation and reassembly (SAR), header compression (HC) is effective to improve the transmission efficiency and achieve lower power consumption. The 6LoWPAN workgroup of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed several standards and drafts to specify the header compression scheme for IPv6 packet delivery in low power wireless networks. Based on the compression format defined in RFC6282, we proposed a new mechanism for the management of contexts, which can improve both power efficiency and time efficiency, extend the content of context information and provide better flexibility.},

@article{Gomez2012,
abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 $\mu$s, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},
