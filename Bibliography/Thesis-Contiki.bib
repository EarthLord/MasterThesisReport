abstract = {Different techniques for measuring packet delivery ratio, packet latency and power usage on single hop radio links have been developed. These techniques were tested with Zolertia Z1 motes running Contiki by measuring the performances of different radio duty cycling protocols using a range of radio wake-up rates and various levels of global radio traffic. Advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques are discussed and the feasibility of enhancing them for multihop networks is explored.},

@article{Dunkels2011,
abstract = {Low-power wireless devices must keep their radio transceivers off as much as possible to reach a low power consumption, but must wake up often enough to be able to receive communication from their neighbors. This report describes the ContikiMAC radio duty cycling mechanism, the default radio duty cycling mechanism in Contiki 2.5, which uses a power efficient wake-up mechanism with a set of timing constraints to allow device to keep their transceivers off. With ContikiMAC, nodes can participate in network communication yet keep their radios turned off for roughly 99\% of the time. This report describes the ContikiMAC mechanism, measures the energy consumption of individual ContikiMAC operations, and evaluates the efficiency of the fast sleep and phase-lock optimizations.},

@article{Michel2014,
abstract = {This paper try to better understand the performance of ContikiMAC compared to X-MAC. ContikiMAC achieves a transmission by repeatedly transmitting a data packet until the reception of an ACK from the destination. While X-MAC uses a stream of small size strobes to advertise the destination of the incoming transmission. A priori, X-MAC is then less bandwidth consumptive. To better understand the efficiency of ContikiMAC, despite an intuitively more consumptive transmitting procedure, we have compared this protocol to an updated version of X-MAC which has been designed with the goal to obtain a more objective comparison. At our best knowledge, this kind of "objective" and detailed analysis has never been produced. Both protocols performances are evaluated in terms of number of retransmissions, latency, packet delivery ratio (PDR) and duty-cycle. Our study reveals that the combination of the fast-sleep optimization shortening the wake-up period with a transmission procedure more efficient helps ContikiMAC to obtain a better PDR at the cost of a reduced latency and energy consumption.},
