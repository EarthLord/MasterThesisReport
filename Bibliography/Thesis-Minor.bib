abstract = {CERN's accelerator control group has embraced ''Open Hardware'' (OH) to facilitate peer review,
 avoid vendor lock-in and make support tasks scalable. A web-based tool for easing collaborative work
 was set up and the CERN OH Licence was created. New ADC, TDC, fine delay and carrier cards based on
 VITA and PCI-SIG standards were designed and drivers for Linux were written. Often industry was paid
 for developments, while quality and documentation was controlled by CERN. An innovative timing
 network was also developed with the OH paradigm. Industry now sells and supports these designs that
 find their way into new fields.},

@inproceedings{Chanal2008,
abstract = {Chesbrough's work on open innovation provides a theoretical framework to understand how firms can access external knowledge in order to support their R\&D processes. The author defines open innovation as a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use both external and internal ideas and internal and external paths to market. He considers that industrial R\&D is undergoing a paradigm shift from the closed to the open model. Information and communication technologies and especially web 2.0 technologies accelerate this shift in so far they provide access to collective and distributed intelligence disseminated in the “crowd”. This phenomenon named “crowdsourcing” is defined by Jeff Howe as “the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined - and generally large – network of people in the form of an open call.” Though this approach may sound appealing to firms and R\&D organizations, there is little research available about the strategic use of crowdsourcing for innovation processes. In this paper we develop the argument that crowdsourcing raises a certain number of strategic issues that we discuss on the basis of a real size crowdsourcing experiment. We were associated in the project from the very outset up to the strategic analysis of the company. Our data is made up of the minutes of three strategic workshops with the managers that we completed step by step by additional theoretical study and some benchmarking of crowdsourcing experiments on the web. Although we started this collaboration with no other objectives than to help this company to design its optimal business model, this action research process has led us to address the following research questions: how can a firm create and capture value by means of a strategy based on crowdsourcing? What are the main strategic issues to be considered when a firm intends to open its innovation process through crowdsourcing? Due to the action research approach used, we do not dissociate the theoretical part from the empirical data, but rather to present our research process step by step. We therefore successively present the three main phases of the strategic analysis carried out with the Crowdspirit team: (1) elaboration of Crowdspirit business model; (2) value creation process related to profiles of crowdspirit community of contributors (3)Theoretical framework on business models based on crowdsourcing. In the conclusion we summarize the main strategic issues that emerged during this work on Crowdspirit's strategy with its managers, and interpret them on the basis of existing literature on open innovation. This leads us to complete Chesbrough's open innovation approach and Nambissan and Sawney network-centric innovation model by introducing new options for companies whose strategy is based on crowdsourcing.},

abstract = {Crowdfunding allows founders of for-profit, artistic, and cultural ventures to fund their efforts by drawing on relatively small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals using the internet, without standard financial intermediaries. Drawing on a dataset of over 48,500 projects with combined funding over \$237M, this paper offers a description of the underlying dynamics of success and failure among crowdfunded ventures. It suggests that personal networks and underlying project quality are associated with the success of crowdfunding efforts, and that geography is related to both the type of projects proposed and successful fundraising. Finally, I find that the vast majority of founders seem to fulfill their obligations to funders, but that over 75\% deliver products later than expected, with the degree of delay predicted by the level and amount of funding a project receives. These results offer insight into the emerging phenomenon of crowdfunding, and also shed light more generally on the ways that the actions of founders may affect their ability to receive entrepreneurial financing.},

abstract = {An appcessory (app + accessory) is a smart phone accessory that is combined with a specially written app to perform a useful function. An example is a toy helicopter controlled by a smart phone app: the full value proposition involves both new hardware outside the phone and new software running inside the phone. Like the smart phone itself and like a PC, the appcessory hardware is a platform: it has the property that it becomes even more valuable if innovative new software is written for it. It is technically possible that innovation in the appcessory space becomes loosely coupled, with different parties specializing to innovate on either the hardware (accessory) side or the software (app) side. However, we are not seeing this loose coupling yet in the current market. We argue that the reason for this is economical: a market framework in which loosely coupled software parties are adequately rewarded is not yet in place. We describe a technical solution for creating the needed market framework, consisting of an automated micropayment system by which money can flow from appcessory hardware makers to app software innovators. This solution also has a broader applicability to the problem of innovation in the Internet of Things.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the development of wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and IPv6-based solution for sensor networks has attracted more and more attention which can enable end-to-end IP communication via the Internet. As far as we know, we implemented the first prototype system to transmit IPv6 packets over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based on BlueZ, the official Bluetooth stack of Linux. To adapt IPv6 packets to BLE link, in addition to the implementation of segmentation and reassembly (SAR), header compression (HC) is effective to improve the transmission efficiency and achieve lower power consumption. The 6LoWPAN workgroup of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed several standards and drafts to specify the header compression scheme for IPv6 packet delivery in low power wireless networks. Based on the compression format defined in RFC6282, we proposed a new mechanism for the management of contexts, which can improve both power efficiency and time efficiency, extend the content of context information and provide better flexibility.},

@book{Chesbrough2003,
abstract = {In today's information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation--which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies--is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, "open innovation," which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the author's own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley. Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms,Open Innovationshows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R\&D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business. Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a company's ideas and technologies.

What ensues is head-to-head competition based largely on incremental improvements in cost, quality, or both.

This path to value innovation requires a different competitive mind-set and a systematic way of looking for opportunities. Instead of looking within the conventional boundaries that define how an industry competes, managers can look methodically across them. By so doing, they can find unoccupied territory that represents real value innovation. Rather than looking at competitors within their own industry, for example, managers can ask why customers make the tradeoff between substitute products or services.

Studying Dell's IdeaStorm community, serial ideators are found to be more likely than consumers with only one idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable enough to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success attempt to again come up with ideas that will excite the organization, they instead end up proposing ideas similar to their ideas that were already implemented (i.e., they generate less diverse ideas). The negative effects of past success are somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse commenting activity on others' ideas. These findings highlight some of the challenges in maintaining an ongo...},
