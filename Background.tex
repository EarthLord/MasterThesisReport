\section{Overview of \texorpdfstring{\acrlong{ble}}{Bluetooth Low Energy}} \label{OverviewBLE}

\acrfull{ble} is a relatively new low power standard incorporated in Bluetooth Core Specification Version 4.0 released by Bluetooth \gls{sig} in 2010\cite{CoreSpec4.0}. This wireless personal area network is marketed as Bluetooth Smart the Bluetooth \gls{sig}. Devices containing only BLE hardware are \emph{single mode} devices, whereas devices containing both classic Bluetooth and BLE are known as \emph{dual mode} devices.   

\gls{ble} was designed by Bluetooth \gls{sig} from the ground up, which helped it achieve certain design goals. These design goals for this wireless personal area network were \emph{low cost, worldwide operation, short range, robustness} and \emph{low power}\cite{Heydon2012}. One most important differentiating factors that has made BLE so successful is the standardization by Bluetooth SIG, facilitating its inclusion in consumer devices and enabling communication across different vendors. In 2013, over 85\% consumer electronic devices supported BLE, making it the de facto standard for low power wireless communication in these devices\cite{Martin2014}. BLE is adopted for various control, notification and monitoring applications, especially in the healthcare, fitness, security and home entertainment industry. 

%\subsection{Design objectives of \gls{ble}}
%
%\paragraph{Low Power} \gls{ble} aims to use a tiny batteries such as button cell to keep a device operating for months to years. To achieve this goal, \gls{ble} was optimized to communicate small amounts of data, such as the states of devices. Also \gls{ble} is optimized to have lower peak power requirements, which allows use of button cells to be used with \gls{ble} devices.
%\paragraph{Worldwide Operation}
%For a technology to be adopted, it is important that there is uniform conformity to the regulations around the world. The 2.4 \si{\GHz} \gls{ism} radio band is the only one available license free worldwide. The technology to develop wireless devices in this band is mature making it the suitable radio band for \gls{ble}.
%\paragraph{Short Range}
%\gls{ble} was designed to be for personal area network like Classic Bluetooth, which means that it is not a network to work with a cellular base station network. This design criterion goes hand in hand with \emph{low power}.
%\paragraph{Low Cost} Lower power requirements mean that the batteries in \gls{ble} devices need to smaller and have to be replaced less frequently, both resulting in a reduction of cost for both the manufacturer and the customer. The use of the \gls{ism} band for communication levels removes the licensing entry barrier for start-ups to develop \gls{ble} devices. \gls{ble} embraces simplicity in its pursuit to lower the cost. \gls{ble} supports only single-hop communication in a star network, which reduces the memory and processor requirement for supporting the protocol. Simplicity was the key factor for the choosing of \gls{gfsk} as the modulation scheme for \gls{ble} to result in low cost, simple implementation of the radio in the \glspl{ic} for \gls{ble}. 
%\paragraph{Robustness} The 2.4~\si{\GHz} space is crowded with devices communicating with various standards as well as spurious noise making the robustness a key criteria in developing \gls{ble} standard. \gls{ble} uses a multi-channel hopping mechanism called \gls{afh} to detect, avoid and recover from interference. In addition to \gls{afh}, \gls{ble} uses \gls{crc} to detect and recover from bit-errors due to background noise.

\label{tbl:BLEstates}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tbl:BLEstates} shows the possible states of a BLE device and figure \ref{fig:Roles} illustrates the ways in which these states can change. The standby role is universally supported across all BLE devices and the other roles are present in device according to their configuration. For example, a device with only a radio transmitter can alternate between the advertising and standby state, usually called an \emph{advertiser}. Similarly a \emph{scanner} can just receive BLE packets.

\caption{State diagram of BLE states}
\label{fig:Roles}
\vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

A connection can be formed between two BLE devices, with the master node reaching from the initiating state and the slave node from the advertising state. This master and slave roles follows an asymmetric design philosophy. A slave is a simple device that can be connected with at most one master at a time and are usually single purpose devices. A master on the other hand is a more complex device which is responsible for coordinating the connections and activities of all the slaves connected to it. A master is usually a multi-purpose device such as a mobile phone, tablet or a laptop. A master connected with multiple slaves employs a star topology. The slaves cannot directly communicate with each other. An example of a BLE network is shown in figure \ref{fig:TopoBLE}. Here a master can be seen connected to multiple slaves. The bidirectional continuous lines show data communicated in both directions when in a connection. The dashed lines show the data from the advertisements being sent broadcast. A master or slave can be an advertiser simultaneously as seen in the figure \ref{fig:TopoBLE}. Note that in this figure, since the advertisers are at the two ends, their signals are not able to reach both the master and the scanner device.

\section[\texorpdfstring{\gls{ble}}{BLE} Stack Overview]{\texorpdfstring{\gls{ble}}{BLE} stack overview\cite{Heydon2012}}

To implement the BLE network described in the previous section, the BLE stack used is as shown in figure \ref{fig:StackBLE}. The BLE stack is split into a host section and a controller section. The controller part takes care of the actual interaction with the radio and enforcing the timing requirements. The controller part is implemented in the \gls{ic} where the radio is located, usually the \gls{soc} or the discrete transceiver. On the other hand, the host contains the software required for handling the various kinds of BLE packets. This separation of host and controller allows mixing and matching of these parts from different sources. The communication between the host and controller is done through the Host Controller Interface. The rest of this section explains the different layers briefly, with emphasis on the parts used in this thesis.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Physical Layer}
This is layer with the actual task of sending and receiving electromagnetic signals with a 2.4 GHz \gls{ism} radio. The modulation scheme used is \gls{gfsk}. The bit rate used is 1 Mbps. There are 40 channels over which BLE operates, each 2 MHz apart from each other. In these there are 3 advertisement channels for sending advertisement packets. These are spread over the \gls{ism} band, located where overlapping with WiFi signals does not occur. The rest of the channels are used for communicating data when in connection mode.

\paragraph{Link Layer}
The link layer is responsible for advertising and scanning when unconnected, along with creating and maintaining connections. The error detection and encryption are also taken care by this layer. 

The process of connection establishment happens when a advertising device gets a `connection request' packet, which contains the specifications of all the parameters required to maintain the connection. The advertising device becomes the slave and the device which sent the connection request packet becomes the master. The three parameters that are primarily dealt with in this thesis are as follows.
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& \textbf{Connection Interval} \hspace{5pt} After a BLE connection is established, the master device must always send a packet to the slave periodically with a time period specified as connection interval. If there is nothing to communicate, an empty packet is sent. These connection \emph{events} provide an opportunity for the slave to communicate with the master. 

& \textbf{Slave Latency} \hspace{5pt} The maximum number of connection events that a slave can choose not to respond to the master. This is intended to save power on the slave while also providing an opportunity to communicate with the master if necessary. If slave latency is zero, the slave must respond with an empty packet in every connection event even it does not have any reason to communicate.

& \textbf{Hop Increment} \hspace{5pt} BLE employs a frequency hopping mechanism to spread the communication over the entire 2.4 GHz band. This is achieved by the master initiating communication in each connection event in a different data channel, among the 37 data channels. The hopping of the master is synchronized with the slave with the following algorithm.

\hspace{160pt}$f_{n+1}=(f_n + hop) \hspace{2pt} \% \hspace{2pt} 37$ 

Where, `\%' denotes the modulus operation, $f_{n+1}$ is the next channel that will be used, $f_n$ is the current channel used and $hop$ is the hop increment parameter sent when establishing a connection.

& \textbf{Channel Map} \hspace{5pt} This parameter specifies the channels utilized by the frequency hopping algorithm. Usually, the entire channel map of 37 data channels is utilized. If some channels are detected to be unusable because of external interference, the channel map can be updated to utilize only a subset which is free of interference. This mechanism is called \gls{afh}, where the channels used for communication is adapted according to the external conditions, leading to increase in robustness of communication.
\end{easylist}

Error detection in BLE communication is performed by utilizing 24 bit \gls{crc} in every packet. A simple acknowledgment scheme is used to request retransmission in case an error is detected or packet reception does not happen. This uses two bits called `\gls{sn}' and `\gls{nesn}'. When a device gets a packet with a particular \gls{nesn},  it must use that as \gls{sn} when it transmits a packet. In case a packet is missed, the device does not know \gls{nesn} and uses the old \gls{sn} in its transmitted packet, thus indicating that it did not receive the last packet. This is better illustrated in figure \ref{fig:SeqNum}. When the slave's packet is lost, the master uses the previous \gls{sn}, thus indicating retransmission. After that the \gls{sn} follows \gls{nesn}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SeqNum}
\caption{Illustration of working of BLE link layer's \gls{sn}, \gls{nesn} and \acrshort{md}}
\label{fig:SeqNum}
\end{figure}
 
Another important parameter used in maintaining BLE connection is the `\gls{md}' bit. The \gls{md} bit indicates if a device has more data to send, so that more packets can be exchanged in a connection event. In figure \ref{fig:SeqNum}, the master has \gls{md} set to one while slave has it set to zero, indicating that the master has more data to send. In this case the master and slave exchange two packets in a connection event until both master and slave have \gls{md} as zero. In the second connection event, both master and slave have \gls{md} as zero, causing the connection event to end after exchange of one packet. \gls{md} bit allows communication of multiple packets in a connection interval when there is large amount of data to be communicated, thus increasing the throughput.

\paragraph{\gls{l2cap}} This layer is responsible for multiplexing data from different logical channels in BLE, although in Bluetooth 4.0 only three fixed channels are used. 

\paragraph{Security Manager} This layer is used for pairing BLE devices, which is a form of authenticating the other device. Typically this is followed by encryption key distribution.

\paragraph{\gls{att}} This layer defines the \emph{Client-Server} architecture used by BLE to communicate data. A server is where data is held in a database and a client is one which gets the data from a server. All data stored in BLE devices as \emph{Attributes}, which is data organized in a specific format containing a label and address. Thus, a client can requests and gets a specific attribute from a server's database. Client or server configuration is independent of the role in link layer. A master or slave device can have \emph{both} a client and a server.

Attributes can be accessed from the attribute database in six ways as listed below.

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Find Requests: Client can find the attributes present in server's database.
& Read Request: Clients requests to get an attribute in server, to which the server responds with the requested attribute.
& Write Request: Client writes to an attribute in server with acknowledgment back.
& Write Command: Client writes to an attribute in server without acknowledgment back.
& Notification: Unprompted by the client, server sends an attribute to a client, to which the client does not acknowledge.
& Indication: Unprompted by the client, server sends an attribute to a client, to which the client acknowledges.
\end{easylist}

\paragraph{\gls{gatt}}
This layer organizes the attributes in a hierarchical manner, so that similar attributes can be encapsulated together. The hierarchical order from the top is as \emph{profile}, \emph{service}, and \emph{characteristic} i.e a profile contains one or more services, a service contains one or more characteristics and a characteristic contains one value and one or more descriptor. For example, a Time profile contains Current Time service, Next DST Change service and Reference Time Update Service. The Current Time service contains current time, local time and reference time characteristics. 

\paragraph{\gls{gap}}
This layer defines how BLE devices discover, connect and present useful information to the users and each other. A device having peripheral \gls{gap} role advertises and then connects to become a slave at link layer. A \gls{gap} central device initiates connection to a peripheral and becomes a master at link layer once connected.

\section[Overview of Contiki \texorpdfstring{\gls{os}}{OS}]{Overview of Contiki \texorpdfstring{\gls{os}}{OS}} \label{OverviewContiki}

Contiki \gls{os} is a lightweight, mature and open source operating systems with extensive networking stack for low cost and low power systems\cite{Contiki}. In this document `Contiki' and `Contiki \gls{os}' have been used interchangeably and mean the same thing. Contiki's networking capabilities include the complete IP stack (IPv4, IPv6, UDP, TCP, HTTP) and the recent \gls{ietf} standardized protocols for IPv6 networking such as RPL multihop routing protocol, 6LowPAN and CoAP RESTful application layer protocol. For the event driven scheduler that Contiki uses, a mechanism called \emph{Protothreads} is used. This results in low memory foot-print and nice flow control in code development. Another tool developed to ease development using Contiki, especially in large distributed systems is \emph{Cooja}. Cooja is a network simulator that has the capability of simulating large scale network on emulated hardware units with fine grained control. Cooja was used in this thesis also to verify designed before actually deploying them. Low power \glspl{wsn} is the typical application scenario of devices running on Contiki, although Contiki has been used in a wide variety of projects.



\subsection{Porting the Contiki to a New Platform} \label{2Porting}
Contiki \gls{os} has been ported to an increasing number of hardware platforms \cite{contikiHw}. Since Contiki is an open-source BSD Clause-3 licensed project, there are many projects in various hardware platforms based on a fork from the Contiki repository.

These hardware platforms' processors range across a spectrum of 8-bit (8051 and AVR), 16-bit (MSP430) to 32-bit (ARM Cortex-M, PIC32). Contiki has support for 802.15.4 based wireless communication with various external transceivers and \glspl{soc} with radio transceiver built in the same \gls{ic} as the \gls{mcu}. Various common features of many platforms such as \glspl{led}, buttons and serial port have modules in Contiki for common \gls{api} across platforms.

In \cite{Oikonomou2011} the authors describe Contiki's port to a CC2430 based platform manufactured by Sensinode Ltd. CC2430 is an enhanced Intel 8051 processor based \gls{soc} having 802.15.4 physical layer compatible radio transceiver. The authors fully debugged the port which had of a code footprint of about 100 kB, varying based on the compiler mode and the features enabled. Many new features were added to the port including support for \gls{adc} unit, all the sensor available on the platform (accelerometer, light sensor, voltage and temperature sensors), watchdog timer and the general purpose buttons. Because of the limited stack availability of 233 bytes, many optimizations such as moving variables to external \gls{ram} memory space and re-writing the radio driver for CC2430 to prevent stack from overflowing.

Contiki was ported to two new platforms, namely MicaZ and TelosB in a Bachelor thesis \cite{stan2007porting}. TelosB, similar to the TMote-Sky platform, consists of a 8MHz 16-bit MSP430 \gls{mcu}, a CC2400 transceiver with 802.15.4 \gls{phy} and a host of sensors to measure light, temperature and humidity. The port to TelosB was done by changing the port to the fully supported TMote-Sky platform. MicaZ platform consisted of a 8-bit Atmel ATMega128L \gls{mcu} and a CC2400 transceiver. MicaZ platform needed rewriting of the code for processor abstraction so that the high level Contiki \glspl{api} could work.

Contiki has been ported into platform based on a ARM Cortex M3 processor to create a device wired with Ethernet to connected to the Internet \cite{Wilde2013a}. Ethernet based networking with the libraries present in Contiki was developed in this project to demonstrate as a proof of concept. There are many unofficial ports of Contiki to various hardware platforms.

\section{Overview of 802.15.4} \label{Overview15.4}
Mention that in this thesis the Contiki specific implementations of the 802.15.4 layers will be tested.

\subsection{Physical Layer}
802.15.4 also uses the 2.4 GHz \gls{ism} band for communication, with this spectrum divided into 16 channels numbered from 11 to 26. The bit rate used for this standard is 250 kbps.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\gls{mac}}{MAC} Layer}

The link layer of 802.15.4 consists of \gls{mac} layer on top of a \gls{rdc} layer. For the RDC layer the Null-RDC and ContikiMAC driver will be tested in each of the test with \gls{csma} as the \gls{mac} layer. In case of Contiki-MAC the receiving node switches on periodically to sense if there are any packets that need to be received. The default time of this period is 125 ms. In case of null-RDC the radio receiver is never switched off, as the name suggests.
